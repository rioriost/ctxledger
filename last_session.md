## Summary

Continued the `0.6.0` hierarchical memory retrieval work and completed a small
**contract-consolidation** slice for the current
**relation auxiliary + query-filter + no surviving episodes** reading in
`memory_get_context`.

This loop did **not** change implementation behavior, widen relation traversal,
change auxiliary-group positioning, introduce broader graph semantics, or add a
new response field.

Instead, it consolidated the documented reading for the already-covered
constrained relation no-match behavior, especially where relation-derived
visibility, returned-episode gating, and workspace-auxiliary coexistence can be
misread.

The current docs now more explicitly state that:

- when query filtering removes all returned episodes, constrained
  `supports`-derived relation auxiliary context does **not** survive
- this is because the current relation auxiliary path is still derived only from
  returned episode memory items
- `related_context_is_auxiliary = false` remains the current reading in this
  no-match case because no related context is actually returned
- `related_context_relation_types == []`
- `related_memory_items == []`
- `related_memory_items_by_episode == {}`
- `relation_supports_auxiliary` is absent from the visible grouped routes
- workspace inherited auxiliary context may still remain visible where
  currently supported

This means the current relation-auxiliary no-match interpretation is now better
anchored in the docs rather than only in recent behavior tests.

---

## What was completed

### Small relation auxiliary no-match contract consolidation slice implemented

A focused documentation pass was completed to align the current service-contract
and MCP API wording around the already-covered no-surviving-episode
`supports`-relation behavior.

The clarified current reading is:

- candidate episodes may first be collected for the resolved workflow
- lightweight query filtering may remove all returned episodes from the visible
  primary path
- because the current constrained relation auxiliary path is derived only from
  returned episode memory items, no visible `supports`-derived relation output
  remains in that case
- `related_context_is_auxiliary = false` remains the correct current reading
  because no related context is actually returned
- workspace auxiliary grouped visibility may still remain where currently
  supported

### Docs updated

The current interpretation was clarified in:

- `docs/memory/memory_get_context_service_contract.md`
- `docs/mcp-api.md`

The updates make explicit that the current docs should **not** be read as if:

- relation-derived `supports` context survives independently of returned
  episode-side memory context
- `supports` targets remain visible merely because relation edges existed before
  query filtering
- relation auxiliary participates in a no-match fallback route
- `related_context_is_auxiliary = false` means relation-derived context became
  primary

They also make explicit that:

- the current constrained relation auxiliary slice is still gated by returned
  episode memory items
- when query filtering removes all returned episodes, the current visible
  relation-derived route disappears
- workspace auxiliary grouped visibility may still remain visible independently

### Why this slice is useful

This slice improves continuity and interpretation quality without broadening
behavior.

It reduces ambiguity around the current meaning of:

- `related_context_is_auxiliary`
- `related_context_relation_types`
- `related_memory_items`
- `related_memory_items_by_episode`
- `relation_supports_auxiliary`
- relation-derived grouped visibility after query filtering removes all returned
  episodes

That is useful because these response shapes are now covered by behavior, and
the docs should say the same thing the tests already establish.

---

## What did not change

This slice intentionally did **not** do any of the following:

- change `memory_get_context` service behavior
- add new grouped metadata fields
- add new retrieval routes
- broaden relation traversal beyond the current constrained shape
- include relation types beyond `supports`
- change workspace auxiliary positioning
- change constrained relation auxiliary positioning
- redesign grouped response structure
- make relation auxiliary survive independently of returned episode memory items
- reclassify relation-derived auxiliary output as a no-match fallback route

The current grouped interpretation remains:

- `memory_context_groups` is still the primary grouped hierarchy-aware surface
- summary-first remains one important grouped selection route within that
  surface when episode-oriented shaping is active
- workspace and relation outputs remain top-level sibling auxiliary grouped
  surfaces where currently emitted
- broader graph semantics remain intentionally deferred

---

## Validation completed

Validated this docs-consolidation slice with:

- `pytest tests/memory/test_service_context_details.py`
- `pytest tests/memory/test_memory_context_related_items.py`

Result at completion time:

- `39 passed`

## Current interpretation

The current `0.6.0` state should now be read as:

- still relational-first
- still constrained on relation-aware behavior
- still not broader graph traversal
- still not Apache AGE behavior expansion yet
- `memory_context_groups` remains the primary grouped hierarchy-aware surface
- primary summary/episode explainability remains explicit enough for the current
  stage when episode-oriented shaping is active
- summary-first query-filter surviving-child-set behavior is explicitly covered
  by behavior and aligned in the docs
- grouped summary child ids/count should currently be read from the surviving
  post-filter primary set rather than from the broader pre-filter candidate set
- top-level summary-first child ids/count should currently be read from that
  same surviving post-filter primary set
- grouped episode output should currently follow that same surviving post-filter
  primary set when memory items are enabled
- when memory items are disabled, the grouped response may remain summary-only
  while still using that same surviving post-filter child set
- `summary_first_has_episode_groups = false` and
  `summary_first_is_summary_only = true` should currently be read as shaping of
  the primary grouped route rather than as loss of summary-first selection
- `primary_episode_groups_present_after_query_filter = false` can currently mean
  either:
  - summary-only primary grouped output remains visible, or
  - no primary episode-scoped grouped output remains visible at all
- `auxiliary_only_after_query_filter = false` remains the correct reading for
  the current summary-only query-filter case
- workspace-only multi-workflow summary-first grouped summaries still keep
  `parent_scope_id = null`
- ticket-only multi-workflow summary-first grouped summaries also keep
  `parent_scope_id = null`
- narrowing to one surviving visible episode does not currently imply stronger
  grouped summary parentage
- inherited workspace-scoped memory remains auxiliary support context
- inherited workspace-scoped memory does not participate in the lightweight
  episode query filter
- inherited workspace-scoped memory does not drive primary episode selection
- inherited workspace context may remain visible even when no episode survives
  query filtering
- that no-match visibility should currently be read as preserved auxiliary
  workspace support context, not revived primary selection
- current workspace-only multi-workflow summary-first reading does not currently
  show sibling workspace auxiliary coexistence unless actually emitted
- constrained relation `supports` auxiliary grouped output remains explicit
  enough to correlate back to returned episode-side context
- constrained relation auxiliary aggregation across multiple returned source
  episodes is explicitly covered by behavior and aligned in the docs
- constrained relation auxiliary `memory_items` ordering is currently best read
  as first-seen distinct target order under the present source-side traversal
- shared constrained targets are currently aggregated once in the relation group
- multi-source constrained contribution should currently be read through
  `source_episode_ids` and `source_memory_ids`
- relation-scoped grouped output remains the primary structured grouped
  relation-aware surface
- flat `related_memory_items` remains a compatibility surface
- `related_memory_items_by_episode` remains a compatibility-oriented per-episode
  mirror
- episode-group embedded `related_memory_items` remains a convenience and local
  inspection surface
- constrained relation auxiliary low-limit truncation is currently best read as
  truncation over that first-seen distinct-target sequence
- constrained relation auxiliary output is currently disabled when
  `include_memory_items = false`
- constrained relation auxiliary does not currently survive when query filtering
  removes all returned episodes
- in that no-match relation case:
  - `related_context_is_auxiliary` remains `false`
  - `related_context_relation_types == []`
  - `related_memory_items == []`
  - `related_memory_items_by_episode == {}`
  - no relation-scoped grouped output remains visible
  - workspace auxiliary grouped output may still remain visible where currently
    supported
- `include_episodes = false` now has explicit shaping coverage for:
  - the baseline episode-less branch
  - the query-present / summaries-enabled episode-less branch
- in that query-present episode-less branch:
  - `query_filter_applied` is not currently surfaced as active
  - summary-first grouped output is not currently surfaced
  - direct episode-scoped grouped output is not currently surfaced
  - summary-selection metadata is not currently surfaced
  - visible grouped output should be read from the actually emitted response
    only
  - workspace auxiliary grouped output may still remain visible where currently
    supported

---

## Key conclusion

The current relation auxiliary no-match contract docs are now better aligned
with the existing behavior coverage.

The next step should still avoid:

- another hyper-narrow metadata addition without a clear missing behavior
- broad relation expansion
- graph-first behavior expansion
- auxiliary-group nesting without stronger retrieval semantics
- generic cleanup for its own sake

The next useful step should instead be one of:

1. a genuinely different small grouped-selection behavior choice
2. a broader contract-consolidation / interpretation step in another part of the
   current response model
3. only later, broader relation/group behavior

---

## Explicit next step

### Next step
Treat the current relation auxiliary no-match reading as documented well enough
for the current stage.

### Recommended target
Choose the next small behavior or contract step without returning to another tiny
relation-group explainability addition unless a clear behavior gap appears.

### Recommended focus
Proceed in this order:

1. preserve the current primary summary/episode interpretation as stable enough
   for the current stage when episode-oriented shaping is active
2. preserve workspace/relation auxiliary groups as sibling auxiliaries where they
   are currently emitted
3. preserve the constrained relation-aware scope:
   - one hop
   - `supports` only
   - current auxiliary-group placement
4. prefer either:
   - one genuinely different grouped-selection behavior slice, or
   - one contract/documentation consolidation step elsewhere in the current
     surface
5. keep the next change semantically small and easy to validate
